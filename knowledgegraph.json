There's no ideal utilization to shoot for, because as with most things, it depends on everything else on your report.

      "@value": "Credit scores especially FICO Scores, the credit scores used by 90% of top US lenders have made big improvements in the credit process. Because of credit scores: People can get loans faster.Scores can be delivered almost instantaneously, helping lenders speed up loan approvals. Today many credit decisions can be made within minutes. Even a mortgage application can be approved in hours instead of weeks for borrowers who score above a lender's \"score cutoff\". Scoring also allows retail stores, Internet sites and other lenders to make \"instant credit\" decisions. Credit decisions are fairer.Using credit scoring, lenders can focus only on the facts related to credit risk, rather than their personal feelings. Factors like your gender, race, religion, nationality and marital status are not considered by credit scoring. Credit \"mistakes\" count for less.If you have had poor credit performance in the past, credit scoring doesn't let that haunt you forever. Past credit problems fade as time passes and as recent good payment patterns show up on your credit report. Unlike socalled \"knock out rules\" that turn down borrowers based solely on a past problem in their file, credit scoring weighs all of the creditrelated information, both good and bad, in your credit report. More credit is available.Lenders who use credit scoring can approve more loans, because credit scoring gives them more precise information on which to base credit decisions. It allows lenders to identify individuals who are likely to perform well in the future, even though their credit report shows past problems. Even people whose scores are lower than a lender's cutoff for \"automatic approval\" benefit from scoring. Many lenders offer a choice of credit products geared to different risk levels. Most have their own separate guidelines, so if you are turned down by one lender, another may approve your loan. The use of credit scores gives lenders the confidence to offer credit to more people, since they have a better understanding of the risk they are taking on. Credit rates are lower overall.With more credit available, the cost of credit for borrowers decreases. Automated credit processes, including credit scoring, make the credit granting process more efficient and less costly for lenders, who in turn have passed savings on to their customers. And by controlling credit losses using scoring, lenders can make rates lower overall. Mortgage rates are lower in the United States than in Europe, for example, in part because of the information including credit scores available to lenders here. Knowing and improving your score can also lead to more favorable interest rates.",

If the inquiries are reported by the lender in a manner that indicates rate shopping for a single loan (such as a mortgage, auto, or student loan), the FICO scoring formula reflects that in its calculation of your score (for a more comprehensive discussion of rateshopping and inquiries, click here). In general, student loan shopping inquiries made during a focused time period (for example 30 days) will have little to no impact on your score. In the rare instance in which a credit inquiry related to a student loan is not coded so that it receives our special rateshopping inquiry logic, that inquiry typically would decrease one's FICO score by only a few points.",
